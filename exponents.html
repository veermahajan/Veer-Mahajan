<p style = "float:none; height:225px;">In this video, I will explain to you what exponents are. Exponents are very important to learn.<br>Here are some of the things I covered in this video: basic exponents (like 3 to the power of 3), zero (0) as an exponent, fractional Exponents, and negative exponents.<br><strong>NOTE: At 2:51 in the video, I claim that 1/3 • 3 = 3. This is wrong, as I skipped 3 to the power of 0 when I was talking about powers of 3.<br>Another way to think about reciprocals: reciprocals are when you flip the numerator and denominator of a number. For example, the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, or 2.</strong></p></li>

<p style = "float:none; height: 225px;">In this video, I will explain what logarithms are by evaluating questions in logarithmic form. Since logarithms are so closely related to exponents, there is also a brief description of what exponents are for those that don't know what exponents are.</p></li>
