      <ol>
        <li>5 • 8 (or 5 x 8) is the same as 5 copies of 8. <br> So, since 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 40, 5 • 8 is <strong>40</strong>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>3 • 6 (or 3 x 6) is the same as 3 copies of 6. <br> So, since 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, 3 • 6 = <strong>18</strong>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>7 • 7 (or 7 x 7) is the same as 7 copies of 7. <br> So, since 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 49, 7 • 7 = <strong>49</strong>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Since a square's defining characteristic is that all of its sides are equal, the area of a square can be solved by knowing the length of only one side. We are told the length of the square is 4 units, so the length and width are each 4 units. <br> Now, the area is 4 • 4, which is 16, so our final answer is <strong>16 square units</strong>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Since the area of a rectangle is simply length • width (length x width), and we know both of these (4 and 9 units, respectively) we can solve for the area.<br>
        length • width = area<br>
        4 • 9 = area<br>
        4 • 9 = 36<br>
        Our area is <strong>36 square units</strong>.</li>
